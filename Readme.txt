This sourcecode is delivered AS IS. I take no responsibility if your system takes damage.
The purpose of this public Git repository is to deliver updates faster, than recompiling and uploading myself.
However, making changes to the source without my permission and publishing them in anyway is not allowed.
Reusing the sourcecode or publishing it anywhere else in anyway is not allowed either.
